# post_install_script

Script to automatically install my preferred apps and packages on a fresh install of Ubuntu

The new scripts for KDE and MATE have been updated for 24.04. 
Snaps are not installed, several Flatpaks are.
Latte Dock and Timeshift repos are no longer used. Those projects have been taken over by KDE and Linux Mint respectively.

The new scripts are currently untested. This line will be removed once testing in complete.
